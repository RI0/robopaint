# WaterColorBot Paint colorsets
Everything you need to know to make your own!

## First Steps
So you've got a new set of watercolor paint that CNC Server doesn't know about?
First you've got to paint a swatch!

All colors shown in the application aren't meant to be the colors as they look
in the set, but **how they look painted on white paper**. That way the
auto-coloring alorithm can be as close as possible when matching drawings to
what they might look like painted.

So, what are you waiting for? Wet your brush, get some nice bright white paper,
and make a swatch of all the colors, with each brush stroke about 2 inches long.
Once that's dried, you're ready for the next step.

## File Structure
CNC Server for WaterColorBot colorsets consist of a minimum of two files per
colorset with a given machine name (EG "my_colorset"), in a folder with that
same name. The whole structure might look like this, inside of this
`resources/colorsets/` folder:

```
 |- my_colorset/
 |-- my_colorset.css
 |-- my_colorset.json
```

We recommend simply copying the [classic_crayola](classic_crayola) colorset that
came with CNC server, and renaming the folder and the two files.

## File Format: JSON
The format for the JSON file is incredibly simple, even if you've never touched
a JSON file before. Just use the existing file, and swap out the name, css file
name, and a simplified version for the baseClass with underscores replaced with
dashes. EG:

```
{
  "name": "My Colorset",
  "styles" : {
    "src" : "my_colorset.css",
    "baseClass": "my-colorset"
  },
  "colors": [
    "Periwinkle",
    "Puce",
    "Purple",
    "Pink",
    "Pugnatious Pug",
    "Pale Parnsip",
    "Piquent Panda",
    "Pumpkin"
  ]
}
```

Make sure you have *only* 8 colors listed, with everything surrounded by double
quotes. Once complete, be sure and run your finished JSON text through
[JSON Lint](http://jsonlint.org) to make sure it's valid, otherwise the app will
silently fail.

## File Format: CSS
Following
[simple CSS formatting rules](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_syntax.asp),
add in each color in the order they are placed on the physical paint set.

Fill in the css color hex code for each one using your keen eyeballs and a
[color picker](http://www.colorpicker.com/), or take a picture in sunlight, and
pick the colors with an eyedropper tool in a
[photo editor](http://www.gimp.org/). You can then add any other fancy rules
you'd like, even gradients, as long as the final css includes a hexadecimal
`background-color` property for every `#color[number]` element in the css.

## Adding it to the list
Once you're done, add your folder/machine name to the
[colorsets.json](colorsets.json) file, in the order that you want it to be
displayed in the app. if we wanted it displayed last, our final colorsets.json
file might look like this:

```
[
  "crayola_classic",
  "prang_glitter",
  "my_colorset",
]
```

Again, if you're ever making changes to a JSON file, be sure and run your final
text through [JSON Lint](http://jsonlint.org) to make sure you're not making
any silly mistakes.

## You're done!
Just reload the main page and your new colorset should show up, selectable
immediately.

Wasn't that easy? Here's a pat on the back and a cocolate chip cookie. Good job!
