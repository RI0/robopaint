WaterColorBot
=============

The software for your [friendly painting robot kit](http://watercolorbot.com)!

This open source project is the reboot for the original
[CNC server project](http://github.com/techninja/cncserver) to focus solely on
clean implementation and ease of install. Anything WaterColorBot specific aside
from bot configuration now lives here, and the CNC Server is now the only module
dependency of this project, running as the API server behind the scenes.

portions of paths aren't drawn.
