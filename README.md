WaterColorBot
=============

The software for your [friendly painting robot kit](http://watercolorbot.com)!

This open source project is the reboot for the original [CNC server project](http://github.com/techninja/cncserver)
to focus solely on clean implementation, user interface, and ease of install. All WaterColorBot specific code will be
moved from CNC Server to here, and CNC Server will be at the root of this project, running as the API server behind the
scenes while node-webkit manages the user interface.

More work to come as I find the time :)
